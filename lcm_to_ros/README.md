Follow the instructions for installing lcm on your system from https://lcm-proj.github.io/index.html

The script `lcm_to_ros.py` can be run on an lcm log file captured on the M-Bot using `lcmlog`. This will convert it into a bag containing IMU, odometry pose estimate, SLAM pose estimate, and occupancy grid map data.

Due to ROB-550 being a graded course, the SLAM implementation can not be made public, however the skeleton starter code all teams have access to can be found here: https://gitlab.eecs.umich.edu/mbotmini
